In this section you will get to know the key notions that will be used throught the course.

Machine learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Machine learning** - is a branch of AI (`Artificial Intellegence`) in programming the main goal of which is to make the machine "learn" how to solve the tasks which can't be programmed explicitly. Nowadays, Machine learning is a really hot topic, as the applications of this sphere extended broadly. For instance let's consider the contemporary smartphone : such functions as voice assistant, fingerprint and face verification, handwritten recognition are included in it, and all of the highlited functions are machine learning driven. Actually, to understand the main difference between machine learning and ordinary programming we can expose the following example :

| Let's say we need to make a programm that should predict the price of the house depending on the number of its rooms (`the example is simplified`). We can try to solve this programm without using any machine learning techniques, just by writing some if else rules. But as the data grows it will become harder and harder to code all the rules to obtain an expected results. A much smarter solution is to train a machine learing algorithm that will find the dependency between price and number of rooms and then will create the rules itself. 

| The picture describing this main difference is pinned below.

The are three main types of learning : 
 
 * *Supervised learning*
 * *Unsupervised learning*
 * *Reinforcement learning*

*Supervised learning* - is a type of machine learning, when given a data/features  (by notation `X`) and coressponding answers/labels (by notation `Y`) an algorithm learns a complex function to map data/features to labels.
