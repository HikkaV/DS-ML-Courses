Reproducible research
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| We made a lot of work till now. But does it matter for other people if they did not understend what we did and how we did the work?

*"An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures."* - D. Donoho

| Consider the situation when you did great research regarding crimes in USA, published the article and then get tons of questions from followers regarding your dids. But if one provide data, code, experiment flow and other information that is relevant to one's research sure there will be much less questions.

| Still not convinced?

Top Reasons for Making your Research Reproducible:
=========================

 * *Ethics – we have a responsibility to show our work to move science forward.*
 * *Funding requirements – many funding agencies require the storage of data and the steps performed in the analysis as part of the effort to increase rigor and reproducibility.*
 * *Catch your mistakes – when you generate a reproducible data document, you are more likely to catch mistakes. Also, your documented steps allow you to trace back to where you went wrong.*
 * *Others can catch mistakes – it is far better that others, like the reviewers for your manuscript or your mentors, find the flaws in your analysis than for them to be buried while countless other students try to repeat your work.*
 * *Others can learn how to perform the analysis – a reproducible research document can be a powerful teaching tool for future lab members or others around the globe.*
 * *Better study design – when you write down why you performed a test, you realize the rationale, because ‘that’s how we always do this’ doesn’t quite cut it.*
 * *Other people who want to do research in the field can really start from the current state of the art, instead of spending months trying to figure out what was exactly done in a certain paper. It is much easier to take up someone else’s work if documented code is also available.*
 * *It highly simplifies the task of comparing a new method to existing methods. Results can be compared more easily, and one is also sure that the implementation is the correct one.*

Please take a look at few articles that are publicly availiable on `rpubs <https://rpubs.com/>`_. All of them using R as main data processing language, but for now we are interested only in structure of research papers. 

`article1 <https://rpubs.com/karthikchawala/303796/>`_;
`article2 <https://rpubs.com/Kallibek/459818/>`_;
`article3 <https://rpubs.com/gcctang1/271126/>`_;
`article4 <https://www.rpubs.com/michelsone/Research_Project_2/>`_.

Listed links are only for educational purposes.

Here is what common in most of shown articles:

 * *Title*
 * *Initials of the author*
 * *Introduction/Synopsis*
 * *Data processing/Environment preparation*
 * *Results*
 * *Summary*

Description of assignment
=========================

Hope one remember data used for previos assignment. Despite the fact that all assignments in this course are following reproducibility rules, but we are going to prepare .pdf article to get better sense of theory in this section. Pdf file prepared from changed notebook of previos section.
