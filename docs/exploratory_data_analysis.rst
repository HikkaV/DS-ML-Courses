^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*"Asking the right questions is what separate Data Scientists that know ‘why’ from folks that only know what (tools and technologies)."* - Kayode Ayankoya

| To be affective Exploratory Data Analysis should target specific aims in form of questions / hypothesis rised by Data Scientists.
