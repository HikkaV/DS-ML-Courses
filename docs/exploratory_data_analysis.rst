Exploratory data analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

*"Asking the right questions is what separate Data Scientists that know ‘why’ from folks that only know what (tools and technologies)."* - Kayode Ayankoya

| To be effective Exploratory Data Analysis should target specific aims in form of questions / hypothesis raised by Data Scientists.
