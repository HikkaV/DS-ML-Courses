Supervised learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this passage you will have a chance to work with Polynomial, Linear and Logistic regressions, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines. The section is divided into two subcategories  : regression and classification. We strongly recommend you to start with regression category, as main concepts of machine learning are exposed there.
